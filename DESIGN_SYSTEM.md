## Design Principles

The design system follows these core principles:

1. **Emphasis** - Using visual hierarchy to guide users to important elements
2. **White Space** - Generous spacing for improved readability and focus
3. **Repetition** - Consistent patterns and elements throughout the interface
4. **Contrast** - Using color and size contrast to create visual interest
5. **Movement** - Subtle animations and transitions for a dynamic experience
6. **Proportion** - Elements sized according to their importance
7. **Alignment** - Clear grid systems for organized layouts
8. **Balance** - Visual weight distributed harmoniously

## Components

The design system includes reusable components like:

- Buttons (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Outline)
- Cards (Basic, Accent, Gradient)
